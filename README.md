## Sorting Algorithms

Sorting data is an important part of programming as it makes for faster search of information.
This project contains functions that implement some of the existing sort algorithms. Files are named
according to the sort algorithm it works on. The corresponding O-files state the time complexity
(best case, average case and worst case scenario) of the algorithms.

# Algorithm Explored are: 

# Bubble sort
# Insertion sort
# Selection sort
# Quick sort
